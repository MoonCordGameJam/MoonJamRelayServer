## Installation

* for faster editing you can add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -G Ninja` to your cmake options
* create `secretkey.txt` in the root project folder, and put your secret key in there

## Notes

* To connect to a room you must send at least one message. So sending an initial message with just your key might be desirable.
